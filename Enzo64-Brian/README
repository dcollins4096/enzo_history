Enzo: README
========================================================================

2006-01-31

By decree, this is the official LCA branch of Enzo.  It can be obtained
by the following:

   setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anonymous@jbpc.ucsd.edu:/usr/local/cvs_enzo
   cvs login [password "amrrox"]
   cvs co Enzo

Only Robert and James have write access.  Everyone who knows the
password has read access to the latest version.

Robert will be in change of code development--nothing goes into the
code without his approval.

James will be in charge of software management, such as tagging
revisions, maintaining the various support files (BUGS, CHANGES,
README.*, TODO, VERSION, etc.), and code refactoring.
