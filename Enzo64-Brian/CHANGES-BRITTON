1) Added Cloudy cooling.
	CloudyCoolingData.h           <-- NEW FILE
	CloudyCoolingGridRoutines.C   <-- NEW FILE
	multi_CloudyCooling.C         <-- NEW FILE
	multi_CloudyCooling_time.C    <-- NEW FILE
	solve_CloudyCooling.C         <-- NEW FILE
	solve_CloudyCooling_time.C    <-- NEW FILE
	global_data.h
	typedefs.h
	ReadParameterFile.C
	SetDefaultGlobalValues.C
	WriteParameterFile.C
	Grid_ComputeCoolingTime.C
	Grid_SolveRadiativeCooling.C

	New parameters:
		CloudyCooling - on/off flag default:0
		CloudyCoolingGridRank - dimension of cooling data minus 1. default:0
        		                0: interpolate over temperature only
                		        1: temperature and density
                	       		2: temperature, density, and metallicity
		CloudyCoolingGridRunFile - path to file containing names of all cooling tables
        		                   (the .run file created by CIAOLoop). default: ""
		IncludeCloudyHeating - flag to include heating from CLOUDY as well as cooling
        		               (depending on the model used in CLOUDY, you don't
                		        always want the heating) default:0
		CMBTemperatureFloor - don't allow radiative cooling below CMB temperature,
        		              even if the cooling data would do so. default:0

	Three options for using CLOUDY cooling in Enzo.
	1. Take all the cooling from the data tables.
		CloudyCooling = 1
		MultiSpecies  = 0
	2. Take all the cooling from the data tables, except the cooling from H_2.
	   Use the equations from Lepp & Shull (1983) (already in enzo) to supply
	   H_2 cooling on the fly.
		CloudyCooling = 1
		MultiSpecies  = 2
	3. Take only the metal cooling from the data tables, and take all of the
	   H,He,H_2 cooling from the enzo cooling routines.
		CloudyCooling = 2
		MultiSpecies  = 2
