========================================================================

2006-04-19 v1_0_2-patch1 [jbordner]

      Fixed bug in performance.h so that Enzo compiles w/o -DUSE_JBPERF
      Added date stamp in MAKE script

2006-04-12 v1_0_2 [jbordner]

      Updated MAKE since Make_AMR_FastSib now generates enzo5u not enzo5
      Changed jbPerf dump frequency from 10 to 1
      Added JB_PERF_LEVELS flag to performance.h to control whether
         to collect jbPerf data by levels (more expensive and not that
         useful).  Currently off.

2006-03-22 v1_0_1-patch1,insight3 [jbordner]

      Reverted Make_AMR_FastSib to be "unigrid" from change in
         v1_0_1-pre3 because "adaptive" is obsolete.
      Revised MAKE to save current compilation state.  No code changes.

2006-03-22 v1_0_1,insight2 [jbordner]

      Changed jbPerf dump frequency from 100 to 10
      Changed MAX_NUMBER_OF_SUBGRIDS from 200000 to 1000000 to lower
          memory requirement.
      Fixed jbPerf restart bug in *EvolveHierarchy.C

2006-03-20 v1_0_1-pre7,insight1 [jbordner]

      Tagged version for initial insight benchmark (version in run
         will still say v1_0_1-pre6)
      Consolidated MAKE.nersc-bassi and MAKE.sdsc-datastar into MAKE
         for Enzo, inits5, Zring
      Fixed bug in jbPerf instrumentation in *EvolveLevel.C

2006-03-18 v1_0_1-pre6 [jbordner]

      Updating jbPerf/PAPI in Make.aix64.<machine> files
      Added OLD_HDF5 around H5Sselect_hyperslab in amr_mpi/src/extern_hdf5.h
      Adding JBPERF_LEVEL_? to control how invasive JBPERF is
      Updated README
      Added MAKE.sdsc-datastar to inits,ring,enzo
      Added OLD_HDF5 to Make.aix64.sdsc-datastar (nompi and mpi)
      Added MAKE.nersc-bassi to make bin/enzo5 and bin/enzo5u
      Reverting Make_AMR_FastSib to be r4 instead of r8 (v1_0_1-pre3)
         to be consistent with other Make_* makefiles
      Added amr_mpi/src/MAKE.nersc-bassi

2006-03-17 v1_0_1-pre5 [jbordner]

      Added memory load and store counters in addition to flop counts
         to jbPerf since POWER5 supports them 
      Added Make.aix64.sdsc-datastar and Make.aix64.nersc-bassi
      Added #ifdef OLD_HDF5 around all #define hssize_t hsize_t

2006-03-16 v1_0_1-pre4 [jbordner]

      Fixed bug in jbPerf instrumentation in OutputLevelInformation().
         Function needs to be called by all processors, but EvolveHierarchy()
         only called it if processor was root.

2006-03-16 v1_0_1-pre3 [jbordner]

      Added "CellsTotal" argument to Grid::CollectGridInformation()
         for jbPerf
      Added Grid::isLocal() inline function to easily test whether
         the grid data is on this processor or another one
      Modified Make_AMR_FastSib to be AMR ;-) and r8 instead of r4
      Added jbPerf counter updates to OutputLevelInformation()
      Updated performance stuff in MakeMacros/Parallel/Make.aix64.mpi
      Fixed bug in performance.h: EvolveLevel.C wouldn't compile
         with USE_JBPERF not defined.

2006-03-15 v1_0_1-pre2 [jbordner ppaschos]

      Modified ring64/macros_and_parameters.h to compile (removed
         #define hssize_t hsize_t)
      Reverted inits64 changes in v1_0_1-pre1, and removed
         #define hssize_t hsize_t from macros_and_parameters.h
      Added ppaschos changes to RadiationFieldCalculateRates.C,
         ReadParameterFile.C, SetDefaultGlobalValues.C,
         WriteParameterFile.C, global_data.h
      Added doc/README.v101-new-parameters documenting
         Pascal's changes

      Updated Single/Make.aix64.nompi to fix DataStar HDF5 library
      Modified inits64/[Makefile|XChunk_WriteField.C|
               XChunk_WriteIntField.C|extern_hdf5.h] to compile
               on DataStar (HDF5-related issues)
      Instrumented X_Main.C
      Instrumented *EvolveHierarchy.C with jbPerf
      Instrumented *EvolveLevel.C with jbPerf
      Updated Enzo Make_* to add performance.C
      Added performance.[h|C]
