3/9/2007
1) added makefiles for Coyote and Pink (LANL clusters).  Also modified
   the Makefile and Makefile.* files in amr_mpi/src so that -D SYSCALL
   is the default.


1/5/2007

1) inits compiles on fnord (my G4 mac laptop).  This took very few 
   modifications - as with Enzo itself, the f90 FFT doesn't work
   correctly, and I had to add some new makefiles.  Modified files:
        MakeMacros/Single/Make.darwin.nompi
        inits64/Makefile.fnord      <------ NEW FILE
        inits64/fortfft3d-mac.src   <------ NEW FILE

2) inits now runs on thunderhead (dual-core G5 desktop).  Only a 
   couple of makefile mods.  Modified files:
        MakeMacros/Single/Make.darwin.nompi  <------ REMOVED
        MakeMacros/Single/Make.darwin-fnord.nompi <------ NEW FILE
        MakeMacros/Single/Make.darwin-thunderhead.nompi <------ NEW FILE
        inits64/Makefile.thunderhead <------ NEW FILE

1/4/2007

1) Enzo now compiles on thunderhead (my G5 mac desktop) and fnord (my G4 mac
   laptop).  Notes on compiling are in the file comp_enzo_mac.txt in the
   top-level directory.  Modified files:
        comp_enzo_mac.txt                                <------ NEW FILE
        MakeMacros/Parallel/Make.darwin-thunderhead.mpi  <------ NEW FILE
        amr_mpi/src/Makefile
        amr_mpi/src/Makefile.thunderhead     <------ NEW FILE
        amr_mpi/src/fortfft3d-mac.src        <------ NEW FILE
        amr_mpi/src/hdf4.h
        amr_mpi/src/mpi_error_file-thunderhead.src  <------ NEW FILE
        amr_mpi/src/stop_all_cpus-thunderhead.src   <------ NEW FILE

2) Files added so that the code will run on my laptop (submitted to
   CVS separately):
        MakeMacros/Parallel/Make.darwin-fnord.mpi  <------ NEW FILE
        amr_mpi/src/Makefile.fnord                 <------ NEW FILE
        comp_enzo_mac.txt

3) Updated amr_mpi/anyl/Grid.h so that it agrees with the version in the
   source directory.  Changed file:
        amr_mpi/anyl/Grid.h
	amr_mpi/anyl/orig.Grid.h <----- NEW FILE

4) Updated original makefile so that dcollins' original flux fix is turned
   off by default.  modified file:
        amr_mpi/src/Makefile

5) Added directory amr_mpi/anyl_mod, which is where I will be adding a ton
   of new stuff soon.

6) Modified src-dev so that it mirrors the contents of src (for the moment).

12/1/2006

1) Added new directory: amr_mpi/src-dev, as well as copied all files over from
   the src directory.  This is for convenience when I add a bunch of Greg's new
   modifications to my version of the code.  Woohoo.

11/8/2006

1) fixed the packed AMR format so that it can restart dark matter-only calcs.
   Files

11/3/2006

1) Got rid of all of the extra makefiles.  Files modified:
	Make_AMR_FastSib         (removed)
	Make_Unigrid_Only        (removed)
	Make_Unigrid_TaskMap     (removed)


2) Added isolated gravity boundary conditions plus a test problem.  This is
   all code from Greg Bryan.  All new code can be turned off in the makefile
   by changing the ISO_GRAV flag from "yes" to "no".  Note that when this is
   turned on the periodic stuff still works - this is basically so that I can 
   completely revert to old routines for debugging purposes.  Modified files:
        Makefile
	PrepareIsolatedGreensFunction.C     <----- NEW FILE
	Grid_SetIsolatedPotentialBoundary.C <----- NEW FILE
	Grid.h
	CommunicationTranspose.C
	UnigridCommunicationTranspose.C
	ComputePotentialFieldLevelZero.C
	MPICH_ComputePotentialFieldLevelZero.C
	Grid_MoveSubgridParticlesFast.C
	Grid_TestGravityCheckResults.C
	Grid_TestOrbitInitializeGrid.C      <----- NEW FILE
	TestOrbitInitialize.C               <----- NEW FILE


11/2/2006

1) completely removed all DC_OPT_SIBSUB stuff at Dave's direction.  Apparently 
   this is BAD in many ways.  Modified files:
	FastSiblingLocator.h
	Grid.h
	CreateSUBlingListFast.C
	FastSib_EvolveLevel.C
	FastSIb_RebuildHierarchy.C
	Grid_FastSiblingLocatorAddGrid.C
	Grid_FastSiblingLocatorFindSiblings.C

2) FLUX_FIX is now turned on in the file Makefile by default.  SAB is turned off, 
   and DC_OPT_SIBSUB is also removed.  Note this is all in the AMR_OPT compiler
   options.  This appears to be the most stable set, though FLUX_FIX may also be
   suspect.  This is yet to be determined.  Modified files:
	Makefile

3) Added Stephen Skory's star particle fix.  This bug was causing enzo star 
   particles to be given identical numbers to some dark matter particles.
   Though non-critical for most applications, it was causing a merger tree
   tool to completely go to hell.  Modified files:
	XX_InitializeGrid.C
   	CosmologySimulationInitialize.C
	NestedCosmologySimulationInitialize.C

4) Added Greg Bryan's modifications to eliminate some code which deliberately
   smoothes the potential.  Modified files are:
	Grid_SolveForPotential.C (one line fix)
	Grid_ComputeAccelerationField.C

5) commented out a check in ReadParameterFile.C that prevented the
   PPMDiffusionParameter from being used in anything other than turbulence
   calculations (ProblemType = 60).  This can now be used for any type of
   hydro calculation, according to alexei.  Modified files:
	ReadParameterFile.C

10/31/2006

1) made galli and palla cooling default in cool1d_multi.src

2) added change to CosmologySimulationInitializeGrid.C which allows enzo to 
   natively do simulations with 64 cells per dark matter particle (and calc.
   the masses correctly).

3) updated my default makefile to turn off some of the flux correction stuff
   that Dave Collins wrote, but which apparently doesn't always work.

4) added a few small changes to FlagCellsToBeRefinedByMustRefineRegion.  It's
   not clear that this actually works yet.

8/8/2006

1)  committed minor changes in Grid_StarParticleHandler.C (removed unused
    comments), HDF5_ReadFile.C (put errorful lines in the parallel IO back in
    but commented out, with notes next to them, in case we ever have to go back
    and check that stuff), and HDF5_ReadIntFile.C (same as HDF5_ReadFile.C).

2)  Added new refinement criteria, FlagCellsToBeRefinedByMustRefineRegion (wow,
    what a mouthful).  Modified routines:
      	Grid_FlagCellsToBeRefinedByMustRefineRegion.C   <-- new routine
      	Grid_SetFlaggingField.C
	SetDefaultGlobalValues.C
	ReadParameterFile.C
	WriteParameterFile.C
      	Grid.h
      	global_data.h
      	Makefile
	Make_AMR_FastSib
	Make_Unigrid_Only
	Make_Unigrid_TaskMap


3) Added a second new refinement criteria, FlagCellsToBeRefinedByMetallicity.
   Modified routines include:
	Grid_FlagCellsToBeRefinedByMetallicity.C <-- new routine
      	Grid_SetFlaggingField.C
	SetDefaultGlobalValues.C
	ReadParameterFile.C
	WriteParameterFile.C
      	Grid.h
      	global_data.h
      	Makefile
	Make_AMR_FastSib
	Make_Unigrid_Only
	Make_Unigrid_TaskMap

6/5/2006

1)  Added loop fix go Grid_CopyBaryonFieldToOldBaryonField.C

2)  Added most of mturk's PPM overflow fixes.  Some were not modified - this
    is because a few are compiler-specific things (for example, the "if(a .ne.a)
    trick) and there are some which are not in accord with enzo programming
    specifics and/or generally good programming practices (for example, explicitly
    promoting some fortran variables to real*8 and leaving others real is within
    the fortran standard, but practically speaking some compilers hate it).
    Modified routines:
       euler.src
       inteuler.src
       intvar.src
       twoshock.src

------------------------------------

5/25/2006

1)  Fixed up some movie format stuff - added default global values, etc.
      (this is to follow up on screwup yesterday)

2)  Added Matt Turk's interpolated data output fix.  Modded files:
      GG_SRB_WriteAllData.C
      SRB_WriteAllData.C
      TaskMap_GG_SRB_WriteAllData.C
      TaskMap_SRB_WriteAllData.C

3)  Modified various Gadget files so that they agree with our printf/scanf
    standard:
      GadgetReadIonizeParams.C
      Grid_GadgetCalculateCooling.C
      Grid_GadgetCoolingTime.C
      Grid_GadgetEquilibriumCooling.C
      Grid_Gadgetconvertutotemp.C
      Grid_Gadgetfindabundancesandrates.C

4)  Added star_maker5.src and calls to it in Grid_StarParticleHandler.C.  This
    version will be the Springel & Hernquist version at some point - right now it's
    simply a shell.
      star_maker5.src <---- new
      Grid_StarParticleHandler.C  <---- modded


------------------------------------

5/23/2006

1)  Added amr_mpi/src-original and differ.bat

2)  changed CEN_METALS in fortran.def to NO_CEN_METALS - so CEN_METALS is now
    off by default.

3)  changed Grid_FlagCellsToBeRefinedBySlope.C to have a setting for ProblemType=30,
    where it refines just on density and total energy.

4)  added a new star maker (star_maker4.src) with Kravtsov star formation.
      Grid_StarParticleHandler.C -- added new defines and calls for star_maker4
        and star_feedback4
      star_maker4.src -- new file
      Make_AMR_FastSib     -- added call to star_maker4.src
      Make_Unigrid_Only    -- added call to star_maker4.src
      Make_Unigrid_TaskMap -- added call to star_maker4.src

5)  changed total number of cell flagging methods from 5 to 7
      ReadParameterFile.C
      WriteParameterFile.C
      macros_and_parameters.h

6)  modified solve_rate.src to increase max number of iterations, and also turn
    off a particularly messy warning output (since it's creating too many huge
    files)

7)  modified Grid_TracerParticleCreateParticles.C to have a small but nonzero particle
    mass.

8)  modified tracer particle output to also put out velocities (controlled by compile flag
    TP_VELOCITY) 
      Grid_TracerParticleOutputData.C
      WriteTracerParticleData.C
      X_Main.C
      Make_AMR_FastSib
      Make_Unigrid_Only
      Make_Unigrid_TaskMap

9)  Put in John Wise movie format:
      Grid_WriteNewMovieData.C                 <-- NEW FILE
      WriteStreamData.C                        <-- NEW FILE

      Make_Unigrid_Only
      Make_Unigrid_TaskMap

  ***  note that outside of the files that have the name 'Gadget' explicitly 
       in them, just grep for the word 'Gadget' - it's not that intrusive.  ***
