Welcome to Jaques.0.2

Jaques is still a dirty hack, since I'm learning how to use the IDL
widgets and basically most features of IDL. So sorry for the
mess. However, I think it is already useful. I hope that the use of
Jaques is worth an acknoledgemnt in the scientific papers and talks
you use it for.


1) What is Jaques ?

It's a whole bunch of IDL routine to visualize multiple mesh data.
Jaques is enzo's best friend.

2) How to install it?

create a directory in which you want your idl routines to live and
untar the jaques.tar file.

mkdir Jaques
mv jaques.tar Jaques/jaques.tar
cd Jaques
tar -xvf jaques.tar

doit is a simple shell script to set one enviroment variable and start
up jaques. clean and install are also trivial shell scripts. 
Make them executable:
chmod u+x doit clean install

Now type 
./install 

IDL will be started and all source files will be precompiled.  I use
RESOLVE_ALL to also precompile all functions ever needed by
Jaques. This yields to a ~4Mbyte large binary file but have better
interactive use. If this is to large for your disk quota simply remove
the RESOLVE_ALL line in TOOLS/pre_compile.com

The binary file will be found in TOOLS/SAV/jaques.sav

3) How to run it?
simply type:

./doit

4) Problems ?

There are many many possible situations the tool will crash.

FIX: none 
you have to exit idl and restart it ;-)


5) Check out the WHATSNEW and BUGS files of the distribution.
In particular the WHATSNEW file gives hints of what jaques can do for you.
