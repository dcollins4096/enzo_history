Changes introduced by Michael Kuhlen (mqk) in going from v0.2r5 to v0.3:

- Port to use IDL's internal HDF5 routines

- Added a pointer array to loaded grids. If a new slice or a new
  dataset is requested, then grids that have already been read in and
  are in the pointer array don't have to be read from disk again.

- Numerous minor changes that I can't recall. :)
