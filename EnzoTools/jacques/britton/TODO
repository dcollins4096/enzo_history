things to do and new features I'm planning to add

minor things to change:
- shading of isosurface starts up with a vector showing in the opposite direction
- vel. vectors color bar stats up black 
- setting and removal of peak buttons is very slow. this can be made
faster by mapping in the background.
- make zoom out work like zoom in

major changes:
- the data structure of the entire tool needs to be restructured
completely. The use of common blocks is complete nonsense for widget
applications. 

new features I'm hoping to implement soon:
- enhanced "insight" support (plotting 1D data, etc.)
- a modified version of SLICER3 that can talk to INSIGHT, read AMR
data, and visualize multiple data fields.
- various options menus that controls widget layout,  startup
values ( inital data_dir, drawing window size, inital colormap, etc.),
physical units
- unit conversions and physical parameters.
- finding the mass enclosed within an iso-surface
- various peak finding algorithms
- pick options to examine data values 
- 3D flow field from velocities
- support multiple data formats to also use jaques for other hydro codes
- adaptive volume renderer, getting the most out of the AMR data


major new features that might be of interest
- one-dimensional ploting of data values along lines of interest
- combination of slices and iso-surfaces
- seperate physics tool that computes absorption lines, spin
parameters, emission spectra etc.
