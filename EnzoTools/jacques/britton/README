I have taken the liberty to change the usage of Jacques slightly.

In version 0.2r5 one needed to call shell scripts (install, doit),
which in turn started up IDL and executed a batch job.

In this version the shell script layer has been removed, so all
actions are now performed from within IDL.

Again, there are three IDL batch files:

1) jacques. Use this one to start the actual program. Within this
   batch file you can specify a directory (data_base_dir) that
   contains all your ENZO data, and the ENZO basename (base_name).

2) compall. Use this one to compile all the Jacques routines. Say you
   ran jacques once, discovered and fixed a bug, and now you want to test
   your changes. You could either exit IDL and start over, or just type
   "@compall", and then "@jacques". Saves you the IDL exit...

3) saveall. Use this script if you want to pre-compile and save all the
   jacques routines. As before the IDL save file will be put into
   TOOLS/SAV. When you run "@jacques" it checks for the existence of a
   file called TOOLS/SAV/jacques.sav, and restore it if it finds one.


Note that it is not necessary to precompile all routines. You just
start IDL and type "@jacques" and off you go, provided you have
specified the correct data directory and basename in the batch file.

Alright, that's all for now.
