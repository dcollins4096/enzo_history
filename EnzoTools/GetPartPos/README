There are too many versions of this routine.  Hopefully the taxonomy
below will clarify what's what:

GetPartPos.C:  The original version of GetPartPos.  Reads in normal
  (i.e. not packed) AMR hierarchies and writes out a 3-column ASCII file
  with x,y,z positions in Enzo's internal position units.

GetPartPosInd.C:  a slightly modified version of GetPartPos.C, which 
  reads in normal AMR hierarchies and writes out an ascii text file that 
  contains the x,y,z position AND the particle index number.

GetPartPos_Binary.C:  This outputs a big binary file that has position, 
  velocity and index information in it.  This is in Katrin's "cosmo" 
  format.
