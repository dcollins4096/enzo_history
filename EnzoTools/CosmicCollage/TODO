To do list:

1.  Finish rebinning routine.  This needs to be modified to take in Mike Norman's 
    new ideas about varied projection sizes.  Also, this now means that the 
    user-defined inputs need to be more thorough.  I need to think about this
    some more.

2.  Finish routine for applying corrections to data (for redshift, etc.).  First
    I need to figure out what units Rick's data is in (in general) and then Eric
    and I have to converge on desired output units for various quantities.

3.  What other things do we want to do projections of?

4.  All major loops need to be OpenMP-parallelized.  Should be straightforward,
    but we need to double check that the OpenMP stuff won't thrash memory.
    In other words, make sure memory access patterns are striped (along with array)
    not jumping around array.  The one this doesn't work with is the interpolation
    routine.  We may just have to suck it up and take the performance hit, though.
    This can be tested easily for scaling at some point.
