StarPartInfoAMR.C

This reads in the files starinfo.dat and time_vs_redshift.dat (which you
need for this particular tool, and is in this directory - also you may
need to rewrite it).  These files have to be in the same directory.  The 
output is two files:  starinfo_sfr.dat and speeddisp.dat.  The columns in
starinfo_sfr.dat are:

1) redshift
2) time (megayears)
3) stellar mass created this time bin
4) cumulative stellar mass
5) dm/dt (Msolar/year)
6) dm/dt/dV (Msolar/year/Mpc^3) (not per (mpc/h)^3!)

The file speedbindisp.dat has two columns:

1) velocity bin (km/s)
2) number of stars in that bin

(this was just intended as a sanity check)

IMPORTANT NOTE:

You have to set the box size, redshift, etc. at the top of the C++ file
before compiling!  If you do not do this there will be errors!  In principle
this should be read in as a parameter file or as command line arguments,
but oh well.  Also, the file time_vs_redshift is only valid for simulations
that start at z=99, and it only calculates up to z=3.  Various bits of the code
depend on assumptions about the file size.  This was a hack and this code was
never intended for public consumption, so your mileage may vary.

compile:

xlC_r -o starinfo StarPartInfoAMR.C  (on DataStar)

run:

./starinfo
