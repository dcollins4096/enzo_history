GetStarInfo:

This thoroughly uncommented and undocumented code (sorry guys)
is run on an enzo hdf5 hierarchy which has star formation and
feedback turned on.  It also assumes that you are running enzo
with the CosmologySimulationUseMetallicityField parameter set
to 1.  Basically all it does is read in the enzo hierarchy and 
write out a file called starinfo.dat, which is a large text
file containing lots of information about the star particles.
This information is in columnar format.  The columns are:

1.  x position		(in code units)
2.  y position
3.  z position
4.  x velocity		(in code units)
5.  y velocity
6.  z velocity
7.  particle mass	(in code units of mass - not density)
8.  particle creation time	(code units)
9.  particle dynamical time	(code units)
10. particle metal fraction	(code units - pure mass fraction)

Usage:

getstarinfo <hierarchy name>

example:

getstarinfo RedshiftOutput0009

inputs:  Enzo hierarchy
outputs:  starinfo.dat
