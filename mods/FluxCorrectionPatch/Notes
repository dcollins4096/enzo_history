Instalation of Improved FluxCorrection package for Enzo.
Notes by David Collins, July 2005.
package by David Collins and Rick Wagner, sprint 2005.

(Almost) all modifications to the existing code are contained within #ifdef JB_OPT_FLUXES_FIX.   
Use that as your guide for the installation.  However, that ifdef is unnecessary, as the fix
is necessary for proper conservation in an AMR setting.  Don't put it in, people will be
tempted to turn it off.

I say almost because there may be a variable or two in Grid_CorrectForRefinedFluxes that
escaped this paradigm. 

If you find this not conserving mass and/or energy, let me know.

All files involved:
---------------------
EvolveLevel.C
CreateSUBlingList.C
DeleteSUBlingList.C
EvolveLevelRoutinesOptimized.C
Grid_CheckForSharedFace.C
Grid_CorrectForRefinedFluxes.C
Grid.h

New Routines:
---------------------

1.)CreateSUBlingList.C
	Populates a linked list with all grids on the 'next finer level' that aren't subgrids,
	but share a face with a given grid (called SUBlings) Accepts and modifies the new
	object:
	
	   LevelHierarchyEntry **SUBlingList;

	SUBlingList[ n ] is a pointer to a linked list of "SUBlings" for the nth grid on a
	given level.

	This routine should be called immediately before UpdateFromFinerGrids, in EvolveLevel.
	See the enclosed Evolve Level for its usage.

	Future versions should accept the FastNeighbor list, to minimize cost.

2.) DeleteSUBlingList.C
	That's pretty explanitory.  Should be called immediately AFTER UpdateFromFinerGrids,
	in EvolveLevel.

3.) Grid_CheckForSharedFaces.C
	Containes grid::CheckForSharedFaces and grid::CheckForSharedFacesHelper.
	Just like Grid_CheckForOverlap, but only looks for exact edge matches.  
	Called from CreateSUBlingList.

Modified Routines:
---------------------
A copy of each routine has been added here, for reference.	

1.) Grid.h
	declare grid::CheckForSharedFaces and grid::CheckForSharedFacesHelper.

2.) EvolveLevel.C
	declare SUBlingList
	call CreateSUBlingList
	call DeleteSUBlingList

3.) EvolveLevelRoutinesOptimized.C
	All modificatons pertain to UpdateFromFinerGrids.  
	I've made the assumption that the Non-Optimized version isn't used.  
	Updates are as follows:
	Send Pass:
		after the loop over subgrids for GetProjectedBoundaryFluxes,
		add a similar loop for the SUBlings.
	Receive Pass:
		after the CorrectForRefinedFluxes subgrid loop, add a similar one 
		for the SUBling.

4.)Grid_CheckForRefinedFluxes.C
	Simply use the copy attached.
	Two things have happned.  Additional logic for the SUBling group has been added,
	which I won't detail here because its god awful tedious.  ALSO, I've uncommented the
	CorrectLeftBoundaryFlux and CorrectRightBoundaryFlux business, that has been commented
	out for god only knows how long.  These fixes update a ParentGrid BoundaryFlux (the
	one it will pass on to ITS parent grid) with the Subgrid's, provided the subgrid
	shares a face.  This is necessary for mass conservation for the same reasons the
	SUBling business is necessary.
